❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created this project to practice JavaScript logic and improve my front-end skills.

🎮 About the Game

Two players: X and O

Players take turns clicking on the grid

The game checks for a winner or a draw

Simple and clean user interface

This is the classic Tic Tac Toe game we all played during school days 😄

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the game

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Game logic and winner detection

🚀 How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser

2. Player X starts the game

3. Click on any empty box to place your mark

4. First player to get 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins

5. If all boxes are filled and no one wins, it’s a draw

🌱 What I Learned

DOM manipulation with JavaScript

Event handling for user clicks

Game logic and condition checking

Improving UI with CSS
